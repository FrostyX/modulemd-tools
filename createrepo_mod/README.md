# createrepo_mod

A small wrapper around `createrepo_c` and `modifyrepo_c` to provide an easy tool
for generating module repositories.

This is supposed to be only a temporary solution, in the future we would like to
have the modularity support implemented in `createrepo_c` itself. See

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1816753

Please see the official Fedora Modularity documentation for the reference of how
module repositories should be created
